# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions from v1/v2 that still apply:
- Semantic CSS variables for theming
- mounted-state pattern for hydration safety
- next-themes for dark/light mode management

New v3 decisions:
- Hybrid A+B+C site positioning (cathedral + journal + product showcase)
- Stone palette, Instrument Serif/DM Sans typography
- Admin panel full rebuild (Medium/journal style)
- No formal documents (EPIS Spec etc.) in v3 scope
- DNS turfu.org only when FR/EN/TR complete
- Supabase only (NOT Prisma) — confirmed by codebase analysis
- New `publications` table (not extending `articles`)
- next-mdx-remote@5 for MDX (pinned, not ^5) — needs validation spike in Phase 10
- [Phase 08]: Stone palette replaces zinc/gray — warmer tone aligned with livrable v0.3
- [Phase 08]: Layer accent colors stay identical in dark mode — only ink/paper/border swap
- [Phase 08]: DM Sans default body font at 17px for readability

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 10: next-mdx-remote@5 RSC mode has documented instability (GitHub #488). Validation spike required before building MDX pages.
- Phase 12: Instrument Serif .ttf must be committed to public/fonts/ for OG image Edge rendering. Verify availability.
- Phase 14: Ecosystem product data storage (Supabase table vs static JSON) must be decided before planning.
