  - ArticleCard with semantic colors
  - TableOfContents with semantic colors
  - MarkdownRenderer with semantic prose colors
  - Content pages/layouts with semantic colors

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - text-foreground for primary text instead of text-white
    - text-foreground-muted for secondary text instead of text-turfu-muted
    - bg-surface-muted for sidebar/elevated surfaces instead of bg-turfu-darker
    - bg-overlay for card backgrounds instead of bg-white/5
    - border-border for visible borders instead of border-white/10

  modified:
    - src/components/content/ContentSidebar.tsx
    - src/components/content/MobileSidebarDrawer.tsx
    - src/components/content/ArticleCard.tsx

    - src/app/[locale]/content/layout.tsx
    - src/app/[locale]/content/loading.tsx
    - src/app/[locale]/content/[slug]/loading.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Keep backdrop-blur dark (bg-black/60) as it intentionally dims content behind mobile drawer"
  - "Keep turfu-accent colors unchanged as they have good contrast in both modes"

patterns-established:
  - "Content components use semantic tokens from 04.1-01"
  - "MarkdownRenderer uses text-foreground for headings, text-foreground-muted for prose"
  - "Loading skeletons use bg-overlay for visible animation in both modes"
